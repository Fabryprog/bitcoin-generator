# libfaketime packaging

Not everyone feels comfortable with installing tools and libraries manually
by downloading and building them from source. Luckily enough, voluntary
maintainers prepare new libfaketime releases for various platforms and make
them available as binary packages or otherwise automatically installable
software.

In this directory, we collect build specification files for the platforms
that we are aware of being actively supported. They help us to analyze
build issues, create awareness for platform-specific patches that had to
be applied and might be merged with our code, and provide the contact
information for future "early release warnings".
